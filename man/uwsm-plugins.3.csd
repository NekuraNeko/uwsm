UWSM-PLUGINS(3)

# NAME

*UWSM-plugins* - Plugins for Universal Wayland Session Manager.

# DESCRIPTION

Shell plugins provide compositor-specific functions during environment
preparation.

Located in *${PREFIX}/share/uwsm/plugins/* and named
*${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}.sh*, they should only contain specifically named
functions.

*${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}* is derived from the item 0 of compositor command line
by applying *s/(^[^a-zA-Z]|[^a-zA-Z0-9\_])+/\_/* and converting to lower case.

It is used as plugin id and suffix in function names.

## Variables available to plugins:

- *\_\_WM\_ID\_\_* - compositor ID, effective first argument of *start*.
- *\_\_WM\_ID\_UNIT\_STRING\_\_* - compositor ID escaped for systemd unit name.
- *\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_* - processed first item of compositor argv.
- *\_\_WM\_DESKTOP\_NAMES\_\_* - *:*-separated desktop names from
  *DesktopNames=* of entry and *-D* cli argument.
- *\_\_WM\_FIRST\_DESKTOP\_NAME\_\_* - first of the above.
- *\_\_WM\_DESKTOP\_NAMES\_LOWERCASE\_\_* - same as the above, but in lower
  case.
- *\_\_WM\_FIRST\_DESKTOP\_NAME\_LOWERCASE\_\_* - first of the above.
- *\_\_WM\_DESKTOP\_NAMES\_EXCLUSIVE\_\_* - (*true*|*false*) indicates that
  *\_\_WM\_DESKTOP\_NAMES\_\_* came from cli argument and are marked as
  exclusive.
- *\_\_OIFS\_\_* - contains shell default field separator (space, tab, newline)
  for convenient restoring.

## Standard functions

- *load\_wm\_env* - standard function for loading env files
- *process\_config\_dirs\_reversed* - called by *load\_wm\_env*, iterates over
  XDG Config hierarchy in reverse (increasing priority)
- *in\_each\_config\_dir\_reversed* - called by
  *process\_config\_dirs\_reversed* for each config dir as *$1*, loads
  *uwsm-env*, *uwsm-env-${desktop}* files
- *process\_config\_dirs* - called by *load\_wm\_env*, iterates over XDG Config
  hierarchy (decreasing priority)
- *in\_each\_config\_dir* - called by *process\_config\_dirs* for each config
  dir as *$1*, does nothing ATM
- *source\_file* - sources *$1* file, providing messages for log.

See code inside *uwsm/main.py* for more auxillary funcions.

## Functions that can be added by plugins

These functions are replacing standard funcions:

- *quirks\_\_${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}* - called before env loading.
- *load\_wm\_env\_\_${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}*
- *process\_config\_dirs\_reversed\_\_${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}*
- *in\_each\_config\_dir\_reversed\_\_${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}*
- *process\_config\_dirs\_\_${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}*
- *in\_each\_config\_dir\_\_${\_\_WM\_BIN\_ID\_\_}*

Original functions are still available for calling explicitly if combined effect
is needed.

Example:

```
	#!/bin/false
	
	# function to make arbitrary actions before loading environment
	quirks__my_cool_wm() {
	  # here additional vars can be set or unset
	  export I_WANT_THIS_IN_SESSION=yes
	  unset I_DO_NOT_WANT_THAT
	  # or prepare a config for compositor
	  # or set a var to modify what sourcing uwsm-env, uwsm-env-${__WM_ID__}
	  # in the next stage will do
	  ...
	}
	
	in_each_config_dir_reversed__my_cool_wm() {
	  # custom mechanism for loading of env files (or a stub)
	  # replaces standard function, but we want it also
	  # so call it explicitly
	  in_each_config_dir_reversed "$1"
	  # and additionally source our file
	  source_file "${1}/${__WM_ID__}/env"
	}
```
